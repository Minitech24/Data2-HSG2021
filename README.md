In this project I test the performance of two different estimation methods namely the Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and Doubly Robust estimation (DR). The two estimation methods are applied on three different data generating processes in a Monte Carlo simulation which is repeated one hundred times. I analyze how performance varies with increasing sample sizes starting from 100 up to 1000 with increments of 50 resulting in 19 different sample sizes and results. 

Code is written in Python and IDE used is Spyder.
